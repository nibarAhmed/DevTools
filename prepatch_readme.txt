[01] Introduction
-----------------

This document contains information about the community maintained version of
Hearthstone Access, a mod which makes Hearthstone accessible for blind players.
Hearthstone Access was originally developed by Guide Dev. After maintaining and
updating Hearthstone Access over a year Guide Dev announced that he was no
longer able to continue working on Hearthstone access. Developers from the
Hearthstone Access community were able to continue developing the mod after
Guide Dev provided some tools and information. To learn more about Guide Dev's
decision you can read his announcement about sunsetting Hearthstone Access
<https://hearthstoneaccess.github.io/sunsetting-hearthstone-access.html>

In addition to keeping up with updates to Hearthstone, the community developers
have added new features. Some notable updates include support for the new Death
Knight class, support for the remaining book of heroes and all of the book of
mercenaries solo adventures, support for the arena mode, and achievements. To
learn more about basics of Hearthstone Access you can visit its original web
site at <https://hearthstoneaccess.github.io/>.  Although Guide Dev no longer
maintains Hearthstone Access the web page still contains lots of useful
information like a basic introduction to the game, instructions how to install
the game and list of keyboard commands for Hearthstone Access.  The discord
server mentioned on the page is also still active and the best way to contact
the developers. So if you have suggestions or have found a bug the best place to
discuss those is the ask-the-developers channel on that discord server. You can
get to the server using this invite <https://discord.gg/WZWRenbuRe>

However notably the installation instructions for Hearthstone Access on the web
page do not work with this community version. Instead please use the
instructions in this document. This document also contains a section about known
issues, a changelog and information about how to contribute to the development
of Hearthstone Access.

[02] Changes to keyboard commands
---------------------------------

There have been some changes to keyboard commands that are not listed on the old
Hearthstone Access page.

- A and shift +a reads the number of corpses for the player and the opponent in
  addition to mana when the Death Knight class is used.
- When focused on your own minion you can use ctrl +f to have it attack the
  opponent's hero.
- F14 and F15 can be used to disable and enable accessibility. These are missing
  from most keyboards and are mainly Intendedto be used in for example
  autohotkey scripts that are used with Hearthstone Access.
- The R, A and O keys can be used in the main menu to quickly access play ranked, play casual and open packs respectively.
- While editing a deck in the collection manager, pressing space while focused on a card with a sideboard will open it.
- While opening a pack, the spacebar can now be used to reveal a random hidden card. This allows players to open packs much more quickly.

[03] How to install 
-------------------

Similar to original Hearthstone Access there are two ways to install: automated
and manual. Updating Hearthstone Access is also done using these same methods.
Notably Hearthstone Access has to be installed again every time Hearthstone
itself is updated. With minor Hearthstone updates, the same version of
Hearthstone Access usually works. But with more major updates changes are
required to Hearthstone Access itself before it works with the new version of
the game. Depending on the size of these changes and the availability of the
community developers, the update to Hearthstone access may take a varying amount
of time from just a couple of hours to a couple of days or even much longer in
rare cases.

### [03a] Automated installation

Community member leibylucw has developed a simple installation tool downloadable
via this link:
<https://github.com/leibylucw/hearthstoneaccess_beta_patcher/releases/download/v0.1.0/HearthstoneAccess_Beta_Patcher.exe>

After downloading the HearthstoneAccess_Beta_Patcher.exe program, move it to
your Hearthstone installation folder (in the file explorer press ctrl +x on it
and navigate to the game installation directory and press ctrl +v). By default
the installation directory is located at:  
C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone  
Once the program has been moved execute it by pressing enter on it. A text
console window opens and you will see the following lines appearing one after
one after some delay:

    Downloading patch, please wait...
    Patching Hearthstone, please wait...
    Successfully patched!
    Press enter to exit the patcher.

After the final line appears you can press enter to quit the program. In the
future when ever you want to update or reinstall Hearthstone Access just run the
program again.

Note: when running the program for the first time you might encounter the
following error:

    Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.

If that happens select the More info  link and then press the run anyway button.

### [03b] Manual installation

You can always find the latest version of Hearthstone Access from here:  
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6K6tVsXpFtPxUSgLTpxtNXVfN24Ym4l/view>  
Press the download button on that page to start the download.

In case you are already familiar with installing Hearthstone Access manually,
the process is the same just with the zip file from the link above. The bit
longer version is that you copy the contents of the patch folder inside the zip
file to your Hearthstone installation directory replacing any existing files
when prompted. By default this is  
C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\Hearthstone  

Below are more detailed instructions:

1. Navigate to the downloaded prepatch.zip and press enter on it.
2. You should now be inside the zip file (works at least on Windows 10 and
   later). There is a patch folder. Press enter on it.
3. You should now see three folders inside the patch folder: accessibility,
   hearthstone_data and strings. Press ctrl +a to select all of them and ctr +c
   to copy them to your clipboard.
4. Navigate to the Hearthstone installation folder which by default is:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Hearthstone
5. Press ctrl +v to copy the files to the folder.
6. You will get a prompt informing you that the folder already contains some
   files with the same names and asking what do you want to do. Select the
   option Replace the files in the destination.
7. After the files have been copied Hearthstone Access has been installed
   successfully.

[04] Known issues
-----------------

Below are listed some known limitations or bugs of the current version of
Hearthstone Access.

- Some features related to the rune based deck building  of the Death Knight class are not yet supported. It is not currently possible to see or manually edit the rune composition of a death knight deck.
- In some cases involving discovering cards or drawing cards or otherwise adding
  extra cards to your hand during your turn, you might be prevented from playing
  a specific card you want or a wrong card is played instead.

### A note regarding unsupported modes

although most game modes are now fully supported, there still remain a few that have partial or no accessibility with the mod:

#### Mercenaries

 Blizzard has [announced](https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23892226) that the mode will no longer get any new content. As such there are no plans to make it accessible at this time. You may be able to play using a combination of AutoHotkey scripts and GoldenCursor positions, which can be found on the Discord server.

#### Tavern Brawl

Work is currently under way to add accessibility for tavern brawls. Because the different weekly brawls involve slight variations on the user interface, some time will be required to ensure that they are all accounted for. It should be noted that once a match starts, it uses the same gameplay code as traditional Hearthstone, and as such is fully playable.

#### Solo adventures

The situation with older solo adventures is similar to that of tavern brawls, as they use different user interface variations and the games are fully playable once started. Support is planned.

Development of Hearthstone Access is based on a development tools repository
Guide Dev made available after he finished maintaining Hearthstone Access:  
<https://github.com/HearthstoneAccess/DevTools>  
The work for the community version is currently done in a fork of that
repository:  
<https://github.com/antonshusharin/DevTools>
